<h1>Incsub Test<h1>

<h5>This is a take home assignment I coded for Incsub. Some of the colors and dimensions are off because I was unable to inspect the task in Figma. I eyeballed them fairly well but they are not pixle perfect, given the dimensions and colors I could have coded them exactly. The design is responsive but the mobile version is not ideal, I would make the mobile layout different if I were to use it in production.</h5>
